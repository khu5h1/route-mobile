HELP :
on_delete values with meanings :  
"No! Please! Don't! I can't live without you!" (which is said PROTECT or RESTRICT in Django/SQL)
"All right, if I'm not yours, then I'm nobody's" (which is said SET_NULL)
"Good bye world, I can't live without article_B" and commit suicide (this is the CASCADE behavior).
"It's OK, I've got spare lover, and I'll reference article_C from now" (SET_DEFAULT, or even SET(...)).
"I can't face reality, and I'll keep calling your name even if that's the only thing left to me!" (DO_NOTHING)
